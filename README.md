### Keras Roadmap
The [Keras Roadmap](/Keras%20Roadmap.ipynb) file contains the stuff I've learnt as I was working with Keras. Some information about CNN is inaccurate, specifically the kernel window shrinking with padding not set to same. This is because I have no background in ML/AI and I was going with what I was reading and trying.
